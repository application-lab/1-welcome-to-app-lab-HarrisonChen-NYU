Hi! My name is Harrison and I am a student at NYU Shanghai. I am originally from Guangzhou, China but I moved to Vancouver as a child. I am currently studying business and finance but I recently developed an interest in software development and learning new coding languages. 

Outside of academics I am interning at an M&A boutique and learning more about investment banking. I also ran the chess club and participate in various other organizations within the school. Furthermore, I try to live a healthy lifestyle and currently play on the schools basketball team and often go swimming in my recreational time. 

I am a very outgoing and extroverted individual. I enjoy working in teams and collaborating with people in a diverse environment to continue to learn new things and collaborate with different people.
